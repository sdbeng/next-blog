## Prayer
A prayer goes to all families that are strugling to get a job or are currently suffering any kind of illness.

God has peace for us.

As our Holy Father says, "We have such need of the light and strength of the Holy Spirit! The Church needs it to walk harmoniously and courageously in the witness of the Gospel. And the entire human family needs it so as to move out of this crisis more united and not more divided."

How I desire that we Christians be more deeply united as witnesses of mercy for the human family so severely tested in these days. Letâ€™s ask the Spirit for the gift of unity, for only if we live as brothers & sisters can we spread the spirit of fraternity.

Virgin of Fatima, stay with us.
