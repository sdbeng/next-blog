## My intership experience at ML

I had a really good time at the internship with Minos Labs.

Besides the superb tech stuck I worked on, the most valuable experience was to get to know, at least for a couple of months, a group of very positive and amazing human beings.

We interacted with interesting conversations and jokes that made the remote sessions seemed like we were in the same office.

I got to especially thank both mentors and teachers that brought life to this project. Just by calling your name or asking a question I felt they put a slice of trust and confidence and always were eager to listen to what I had to say.

We ended up working in a group with 6 fellow developers in a capstone project, they shared empathy and understanding to each other. 

This is what I take with me and will remember after several years.


Have a great summer and look forward to chat with them next time!

Happy coding!
