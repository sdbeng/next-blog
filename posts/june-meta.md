It's a beautiful day. Yet, the same day as before where you don't know what direction to take at first. Lots of docs to read, a few projects half way done to finish anothe JS or Py app. I turn on for the first time my ceiling fun, it's a hot Monday, almost summer I can tell because the sun burns your skin as soon as you spend more than few seconds out the patio.

One goal I have is to write several blog posts a week, keep it up all green `git commits` and `git push`(es), every day counts, every line of code matters.`

The pandemic is still uncontrolable and some people are careful while others forgot they can be still exposed if don't wear masks or gloves. 

But we need to remember who are the ones really suffering during this crisis, the families that can't afford to pay their rent or go buy one little thing at the supermarket to keeps their kids fed or even hundreds of homeless who don't even have basics needs or a roof on their heads.

After lunch, I turn on my tv and watch al old tv series that I liked when I was a little kid, kind of makes me forget for a while.

Now, it's time to go back to your pending tasks, still that company won't reply with the results of the second interview. It's okay, I learn from having more interview and pick the ones that really matters.

I pray for the families so they can go back to work and be happy with their lives, yet I'm sure now they feel pretty much closer to thei kids and how they endured this time together.

Another day, but at the end I feel bless I have a family and God is taking care of us if we have faith.
