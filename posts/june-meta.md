It's a beautiful day. Yet, the same day as before where you don't know what direction to take at first. Lots of docs to read, a few projects half way done to finish anothe JS or Py app. I turn on for the first time my ceiling fun, it's a hot Monday, almost summer and I can tell because the sun burns your skin as soon as you spend more than few seconds out the patio.

One goal I have is to write several blog posts a week, keep it up all green `git commits` and `git push`(es), every day counts, every line of code matters.

The pandemic is still uncontrolable and some people are careful while others forgot they can be still exposed if don't wear masks or gloves. 

But we need to remember who are the ones really suffering during this crisis, the families that can't afford to pay their rent or go buy one little thing at the supermarket to keeps their kids fed or even hundreds of homeless who don't even have basics needs or a roof on their heads.

After lunch, decided to take 30 min break so I turned on my tv and watched an old tv series that I liked when I was a little kid, kind of makes me forget for a while.

Now, it's time to go back to your pending tasks, still a couple of companies won't reply with the results of the second interview. It's okay, I learnt from having to fall and rise again and pick the ones that really matters. Your attitude its the key here. Companies will always look for golden eggs forgetting the we are simple devs that are willing to build anything from scratch.

I pray for the families so they can go back to work and be happy with their lives, yet I'm sure now they feel pretty much closer to their kids and how they endured this time together.

Another day, but at the end I feel bless that I have a family they care about me and God is always giving us the strengt to get up and walk every day, Yes! We have faith.
