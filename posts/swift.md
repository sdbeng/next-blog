## 🍎 SwiftUI Year

I have started my very own #60daysofswiftuicode marathon! 🏃🏻

In the past years, I wrote a lot of code and developed iPhone & iPad apps with Objective-C. Had a lot of accomplisments and challenges that made me proud and thankful. Published several iOS apps in the App Store. OMG! Lots of nights and days well spent learning and researching to finally hit those goals.🚀

Now, I am very happy to say that I took the desicion to code the new designs of future iOS apps by adopting the awesome SwiftUI API. Of course, I need to be willing to work with UIKit, if necessary, so it seems Apple took the right direction to go with SwiftUI and its new views design model, MVVM.

In this 2021, I look forward to work hard, as well as take more breaks to take care of my health. Here I come swimming pool!!🏊‍♂️
