## Hello C++, not just old good dreams

I wanted to share that I'm currently working on a A* search application with C++. I have just passed the first stage and look forward to continue to next stage of planning the path.

This is a 4-month journey and I've been researching a lot to see what possibilities I have to build something with the C++ low level programming. The good news is that with a lot of effort and patience, plus taking breaks I can build something awesome.

I remember my college days how proud I was by being exposed to that programming language but I believe I needed a bit of maturity and time to understand the code structures.

More updates, hopefully soon!

Happy coding!
