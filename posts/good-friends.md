Today, I had a nice surprise of old friends writing on my timeline. 

Friends from college and from Saint Claret group, pictures with 100 memories and laughs, overall it was a lovely time growing up and experiencing lots of things together:)

Hope they are all safe and healthy. I pray they can continue living their lives with happiness and faith in God. 

Thank you for being my friends!! Gracias por estar ahi amigos!
