## Summer is the beast time of the year!
Hey there! Hope you and your family are safe and healthy.

So far, it's being an interesting summer. I went camping and spent wonderful days under the sun and stars. In the afternoon, enjoyed swimming in the lakes near by the camp, which by the way the water was great!! Bike riding and cooking some bbq's with firewood was also exciting, but most of all I really took the time to think about the family, the future jobs and what I can build or do in the upcoming months.

Tech speaking, I've been building so far few full stack apps, brushing up on front end UI and vanilla JS, applying to some bootcamps and playing with Kotlin(I really like the syntax). Ah! also creating several videos about vanilla JS for a potential web dev codecamp.

How about you? What's in your plate for the rest of 2020?

I sincerely hope and this time will pass and we all look forward to be more patience with each other, have faith in each other. We'll overcome this situation.

Have a great day! Until next time!
