## Apple's WWDC 2020 Conference Kick off
My favorite conference, by a mile. It brings memories from 5 years ago and makes me feel proud of all effort put in to build those iOS apps for the conference in CA.

This year is special due to the covid-19 so the event is free for everyone.

Lots of things happening according to Twitter and several news and blogs.

## Announcements

- Mac transition to Apple Silicon
- iOS/iPadOS 14
- macOS Big Sur (Yay!!!!)
