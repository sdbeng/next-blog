## Starter
This is a starter template for [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn).

## Summary
- Next.js automatically optimizes your application for the best performance by code splitting, client-side navigation, and prefetching (in production).
- You create routes as files under pages and use the built-in Link component. No routing libraries are required.

**Note:** If you need to link to an external page outside the Next.js app, just use an <a> tag without Link.

If you need to add attributes like, for example, className, add it to the a tag, not to the Link tag.

## so far:

To use CSS Modules, import a CSS file named *.module.css from any component.
To use global CSS, import a CSS file in pages/_app.js.

**tip** Make sure you restart the development server when you add _app.js.

### pre-rendering
If your app is a plain React.js app (without Next.js), there’s no pre-rendering, so you won’t be able to see the app if you disable JavaScript. Instead you'll see "You need to enable JavaScript to run this app." This is because the app is not pre-rendered into static HTML.

## Two Forms of Pre-rendering
Next.js has two forms of pre-rendering: Static Generation and Server-side Rendering. The difference is in when it generates the HTML for a page.

Static Generation is the pre-rendering method that generates the HTML at build time. The pre-rendered HTML is then reused on each request.
Server-side Rendering is the pre-rendering method that generates the HTML on each request.

## Per-page Basis
Importantly, Next.js lets you choose which pre-rendering form to use for each page. You can create a "hybrid" Next.js app by using Static Generation for most pages and using Server-side Rendering for others.

## When to Use Static Generation v.s. Server-side Rendering
We recommend using Static Generation (with and without data) whenever possible because your page can be built once and served by CDN, which makes it much faster than having a server render the page on every request.

You can use Static Generation for many types of pages, including:

Marketing pages
Blog posts
E-commerce product listings
Help and documentation
You should ask yourself: "Can I pre-render this page ahead of a user's request?" If the answer is yes, then you should choose Static Generation.

On the other hand, Static Generation is not a good idea if you cannot pre-render a page ahead of a user's request. Maybe your page shows frequently updated data, and the page content changes on every request.

In that case, you can use Server-Side Rendering. It will be slower, but the pre-rendered page will always be up-to-date. Or you can skip pre-rendering and use client-side JavaScript to populate data.

## Static Generation with and without Data
Static Generation can be done with and without data.

So far, all the pages we’ve created do not require fetching external data. Those pages will automatically be statically generated when the app is built for production.

However, for some pages, you might not be able to render the HTML without first fetching some external data. Maybe you need to access the file system, fetch external API, or query your database at build time. Next.js supports this case — **Static Generation with data — out of the box**.

## Static Generation with Data using getStaticProps
How does it work? Well, in Next.js, when you export a page component, you can also export an async function called getStaticProps. If you do this, then:

getStaticProps runs at build time in production, and…
Inside the function, you can fetch external data and pass that as the props of the page.
```
export default function Home(props) { ... }

export async function getStaticProps() {
  // Get external data from the file system, API, DB, etc.
  const data = ...

  // The value of the `props` key will be
  //  passed to the `Home` component
  return {
    props: ...
  }
}
```
Essentially, getStaticProps allows you to tell Next.js: “Hey, this page has some data dependencies — so when you pre-render this page at build time, make sure to resolve them first!”

Note: In development mode, getStaticProps runs on each request instead.
