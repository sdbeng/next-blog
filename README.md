## Starter
This is a starter template for [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn).

## summary
- Next.js automatically optimizes your application for the best performance by code splitting, client-side navigation, and prefetching (in production).
- You create routes as files under pages and use the built-in Link component. No routing libraries are required.

**Note:** If you need to link to an external page outside the Next.js app, just use an <a> tag without Link.

If you need to add attributes like, for example, className, add it to the a tag, not to the Link tag.

## so far:

To use CSS Modules, import a CSS file named *.module.css from any component.
To use global CSS, import a CSS file in pages/_app.js.

**tip** Make sure you restart the development server when you add _app.js.
